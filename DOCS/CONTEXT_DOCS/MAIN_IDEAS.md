# How to Transform Script into Visuals

1. Start with the Script

Your script is your foundation. It can be made of:

* **Phrases** — short, complete ideas.
  
* **Keywords** — single important words that stand out.
  

Make sure the visuals _compliment_ the script.

* Scripts often contain **phrases** and **keywords**.
  
* Sometimes the script gives you more keywords than full phrases.
  

Break the script into smaller meaningful parts:Example script snippet:

> _Risk management is so important, no matter what position you're in life, because if you have $3,000 in the bank and you think, ‘Okay, you could make a bit of money, but also lose everything,’ that's why you need to work on businesses where even if you fail for 12 months..._

Chunked:

* Risk management is so important
  
* Doesn't matter what position you're in life
  
* Because if you have $3,000 in the bank
  
* And you think, okay...
  

3. Extract Keywords and Phrases

From each chunk, list the **keywords** and **phrases** separately.

**Keywords example:**

Because if you have $3,000 in the bank:

* $3,000
  
* You
  
* Bank
  

**Phrases example:**

* Risk management is so important
  
* Position you’re in life
  
* You have $3,000 in the bank
  

_Tip:_ You can split a phrase further into micro-phrases.Example: _"Doesn't matter what position you're in life"_ → `["you", "position", "position in life"]`

# 4 Think in Visual Problems

Once you have your keywords and phrases, think of them as **problems to solve visually**.Ask: **"How can I show this to the viewer?"**

Example:Phrase: “position you’re in life”

* If your audience is mostly doctors or programmers, you could show a doctor or programmer.
  
* You don’t _have_ to match the audience exactly, but when viewers see something relatable, it creates a stronger connection.

5. Types of Visual Presentation

* * *

| Type | Description | Example Ideas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Literal** | Direct, straightforward visuals | Show a bank building for "$3,000 in bank" |
| **Characters** | Use people or animated figures to express emotion or story | Person worried looking at money, or stressed worker |
| **Metaphorical** | Symbols or abstract ideas to represent concepts | Chessboard to symbolize “position in life” or “strategy” |
| **Objects/Things** | Use specific objects related to keywords | Clock for “time”, money for “wealth” |
| **Diagrams** | Minimalist charts or mindmaps for complex ideas | Mindmap: You → Life → Career paths |

6. Match Style to Script
  

* **Literal** → Best for straightforward ideas.
  
* **Metaphorical** → Great for artistic or symbolic storytelling. (ADDITION artistic, creative, or abstract storytelling (great for collages).)
  
* **Characters** → Best for scenarios and emotions.
  
* **Objects** → Good for concrete, physical concepts (money, buildings).
  
* **Diagram** → Perfect for complex ideas (keep it minimal).
  

Example:

> Script: _“Because if you have $3,000 in the bank and you think, ‘Okay…’”_Possible visuals:

* **Literal:** Show a bank balance.
  
* **Objects:** Stack of cash, vault, coins.
  
* **Metaphorical:** Tree growing from a coin (symbolizing growth).
  

Summary

* **Chunk the script → Extract keywords/phrases → Decide type of visual → Create or select visuals that represent or evoke the idea**
  
* Mix literal, character, metaphorical, object, or diagram visuals depending on the content and style.
