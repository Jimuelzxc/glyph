**DEV_LOG.md Management Instructions**

This document outlines the rules for interacting with my development log. Please follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Add all mentioned items:** Whenever I mention a bug, feature request, or general note, automatically add it to this `DEV_LOG.md` file.
2.  **Clarify when necessary:** If my notes are unclear, rewrite them into clear Keep the original meaning intact and concise wording before adding them.
3.  **Use the correct section:** Categorize all new entries into the appropriate section: **Bugs**, **Feature Requests**, or **General Notes**.
4.  **Do not fix anything:** Under no circumstances should you attempt to fix, implement, or take any action on the items listed. Your only task is to log the information for future reference.
5.  **Seek my approval:** After adding the new entry, **pause and ask me for confirmation.** State, "I have updated the DEV_LOG.md file with your notes. Please review and let me know if you are satisfied or if any revisions are needed."
6.  **Status indicators:** Use '❌' for pending items and '✅' for completed ones.
